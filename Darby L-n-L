IBM Vet BRG Lunch-n-learn: The Darby Project and RunRangerRun event.


Come join us for an opportunity to learn about a veteran’s organization that is pioneering a new way service members are transitioning into civilian life. Bryce Mahoney, Director of The Darby Project, will be talking about how his organization is making an impact in the veteran’s community and about their fundraising event, RunRangerRun. 

Bryce is a former Army Ranger with the 75th Ranger Regiment and deployed to Afghanistan weeks after 9/11. Like many of us, Bryce knows first-hand about the challenges of transitioning from military life to civilian life. He has a passion for improving the process and can share why some veterans get too far off azimuth that leads down a road to hitting rock bottom.  

Come learn about how you can be a part of what this organization is doing and be inspired to share your knowledge with those getting out of the military. 

The Darby Projects annual fundraiser is called RunRangerRun and starts the month of February. We have an IBM Veterans team for the event and we will learn about how RunRangerRun came about. 


When: Monday, February 12th
Time: 12:00-1:00 pm
